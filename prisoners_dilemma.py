"""
Simulates an iterated prisoner's dilemma game between two participants. The game is played in rounds, where each participant
chooses to either cooperate or defect. The points are assigned based on the actions of both participants. The objective is to
score more points than the other participant.

Slightly hacky approach when using Inspect AI, as while there are multiple "data points", they are not independent of each other.
Because of this, we are using a single task state to store the state of the game for both participants. This will make it
difficult to interpret the progress bar unfortunately, as it relies on the number of data points to determine the progress.
