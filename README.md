# Prisoner's dilemma

Inspired by the classic [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) game, this pits 2 (or more) agents against one-another in an iterated variant. The agents are both instructed to favour winning, and will exchange messages back-and-forth before choosing whether to defect or not.

## Setup

There are two types of actors:

1. The LLM agents playing the game
2. Secondary LLMs that will try to predict whether a player is going to defect or not.

The secondary LLMs have access to the messages from the current round and all previous round messages and decisions.

In this PoC, both types are `o3-mini-2025-01-31`.

The game will play out as N rounds of:

1. The agents send each other a message
2. A classifier will try to predict the player actions
2. The agents pick their action (COOPERATE or DEFECT)
3. The agents reason about the round and plan their next steps

## Environment

This project is managed with https://docs.astral.sh/uv/.

To get started, run: `uv sync`.

## Command

Remember to set OPENAI_API_KEY (depending on model choices).

`inspect eval prisoners_dilemma.py@play_game`

## Eval

After every game, a log file will be created that records:

1. Win/draw/loss statistics per player for each round
2. Classifier metrics (confusion matrix)

## Examples

See the `/runs/` folder for some concrete examples.

## On scheming

The term scheming is used rather loosely here. While the agents are not actually scheming in e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04984, the behaviour of telling a participant that you are going to cooperate and then choose the DEFECT action mirrors scheming behaviour. It does show that models will generally send pro-social messages (i.e. encourage cooperation and mutual trust), but still very much try to win the game when instructed to.

## Example metrics

Classification metrics for the auxiliary model predicting whether a participant would defect or not.

Corresponds to run `draw_02.eval`.
